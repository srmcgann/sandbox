you may insert ``code snippets`` like this

or whole code blocks...

```js
myFunc = () => {
  var str = "like this"
  return str
}
```

One great feature of ``coordocs`` is that you can paginate your doc!

for example, use this tag to split your document
onto as many pages as you like:

<pagebreak/>

# A new page!

### links and images

links use [this format](https://github.com)<br><br>

and images, similarly
